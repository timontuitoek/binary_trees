<h1>Binary tree</h1>
<br>
<p>binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.</p>

<p>In computing, binary trees can be used in two very different ways:</p>
<p>First, as a means of accessing nodes based on some value or label associated with each node.[9] Binary trees labelled this way are used to implement binary search trees and binary heaps, and are used for efficient searching and sorting.</p>
<p>Second, as a representation of data with a relevant bifurcating structure. In such cases, the particular arrangement of nodes under and/or to the left or right of other nodes is part of the information (that is, changing it would change the meaning).<p>
